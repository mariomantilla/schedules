  </summary>

You can use Typescript in both your frontend React code (with `react-scripts` v2.1+) and your serverless functions (with `netlify-lambda` v1.1+). Follow these instructions:

1. `yarn add -D typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @babel/preset-typescript @types/aws-lambda`
2. convert `src/lambda/hello.js` to `src/lambda/hello.ts`
3. use types in your event handler:

```ts
import { Handler, Context, Callback, APIGatewayEvent } from 'aws-lambda'

interface HelloResponse {
  statusCode: number
  body: string
}

const handler: Handler = (event: APIGatewayEvent, context: Context, callback: Callback) => {
  const params = event.queryStringParameters
  const response: HelloResponse = {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      msg: `Hello world ${Math.floor(Math.random() * 10)}`,
      params,
    }),
  }

  callback(undefined, response)
}

export { handler }
```

rerun and see it work!

You are free to set up your `tsconfig.json` and `tslint` as you see fit.

**If you want to try working in Typescript on the client and lambda side**: There are a bunch of small setup details to get right. Check https://github.com/sw-yx/create-react-app-lambda-typescript for a working starter.

## Routing and authentication with Netlify Identity

For a full demo of routing and authentication, check this branch: https://github.com/netlify/create-react-app-lambda/pull/18 This example will not be maintained but may be helpful.

## Service Worker

`create-react-app`'s default service worker (in `src/index.js`) does not work with lambda functions out of the box. It prevents calling the function and returns the app itself instead ([Read more](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/2237#issuecomment-302693219)). To solve this you have to eject and enhance the service worker configuration in the webpack config. Whitelist the path of your lambda function and you are good to go.
